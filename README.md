Simple Filter Mixer
===================

Simple Filter Mixer is an example application for Windows Phone demonstrating the use of Nokia Imaging SDK APIs, combining multiple filters together and demonstrating each of the available filter in the SDK. This sample also demonstrates on-demand creation of the filters using reflection.

This example application is hosted in GitHub:
https://github.com/nokia-developer/simple-filter-mixer/

Developed with Microsoft Visual Studio 2013.

Compatible with:

 * Windows Phone 8

Tested to work on:

 * Nokia Lumia 1020
 

Instructions
------------

Make sure you have the following installed:

 * Windows 8
 * Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows Phone
 * Nuget 2.7 or later

To build and run the sample in emulator

1. Open the SLN file:
   File > Open Project, select the solution (.sln postfix) file
2. Select the target 'Emulator' and platform 'x86'.
3. Press F5 to build the project and run it.


If the project does not compile on the first attempt it's possible that you
did not have the required packages yet. With Nuget 2.7 or later the missing
packages are fetched automatically when build process is invoked, so try
building again. If some packages cannot be found there should be an
error stating this in the Output panel in Visual Studio Express.
